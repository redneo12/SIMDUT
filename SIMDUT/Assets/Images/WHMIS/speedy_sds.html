		<b>Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:</b> All persons dealing with the clean-up should wear the appropriate chemically protective equipment. Keep people away from and upwind of spilt/leak. Restrict access to area until completion of clean-up. Refer to protective measures listed in sections 7 and 8. <br>
		<b>Methods and material for containment and cleaning up:</b> Do not allow material to contaminate ground water system. If necessary, dike well ahead of the spill to prevent runoff into drains, sewers, or any natural waterway or drinking supply. Ventilate the area. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Soak up with inert absorbent material. Do not use combustible absorbents, such as sawdust. Pick up and transfer to properly labeled containers. Contaminated absorbent material may pose the same hazards as the spilled product. Contact the proper local authorities. <br>

		<b>Exposure controls:</b><br>
		<div class='sub_content'>
			<b>Ventilation and engineering measures:</b> Use only in well-ventilated areas. Apply technical measures to comply with the occupational exposure limits. Where reasonably practicable this should be achieved by the use of local exhaust ventilation and good general extraction. In case of insufficient ventilation wear suitable respiratory equipment. <br>
			<b>Respiratory protection:</b> If airborne concentrations are above the permissible exposure limit or are not known, use NIOSH-approved respirators. Respirators should be selected based on the form and concentration of contaminants in air, and in accordance with OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134). Advice should be sought from respiratory protection specialists. <br>
			<b>Skin protection:</b> Wear protective gloves. Where extensive exposure to product is possible, use resistant coveralls, apron and boots to prevent contact. The suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed with the producers of the protective regimes. <br>
			<b>Eye face protection:</b> Wear eye/face protection. Wear as appropriate tightly fitting safety goggles; Safety glasses with side-shields. <br>
			<b>Other protective equipment:</b> Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location. Other equipment may be required depending on workplace standards. <br>
			<b>General hygiene considerations:</b> Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product. Wash exposed areas thoroughly after handling. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before re-use. Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. <br>
